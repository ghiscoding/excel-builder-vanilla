## Documentation

ðŸ“˜ [Documentation](https://ghiscoding.gitbook.io/excel-builder-vanilla/) website powered by GitBook (_previous project docs pulled from [web archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20160907052007/http://excelbuilderjs.com)_)

## Description

This lib allows you to build and write an Excel file dynamically, it does **not** include any reader capabilities making it super lightweight.

## Live Demo

Visit the [**Live demo**](https://ghiscoding.github.io/excel-builder-vanilla/) to get started and see all available options and methods that the library offers.<br>
You can also take a look at the "[Used by](#used-by)" section below to see real world applications taking advantage of this library.

## Project History
Excel-Builder-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [excel-builder.js](https://github.com/stephenliberty/excel-builder.js) project (thanks to @stephenliberty for this great library). The main goal in creating this fork was to modernize the project by removing dependencies that are no longer necessary and replace `JSZip` by `fflate` which provides an ESM build giving us Tree Shaking. The other goal was also to provide an ESM bundle to slowly get away from CommonJS (CJS bundle is still offered but we strongly suggest you migrate to the ESM approach)

The modernization steps:
- migrate to TypeScript (giving us TS Types `d.ts`)
- drop `Q` dependency (we simply use native `Promise`)
- drop `Lodash` dependency (we now use native JS code)
- replace `JSZip` dependency with [`fflate`](https://github.com/101arrowz/fflate) which has an ESM build and offers better performance.
- bump version to `v3.0.0` as a `major` release (_the original project version was in the `2.x` range._)
  - note that the changelog did not exists before `v3.0.0`

This modernization is providing a huge decrease in the final build size and is offering better performance ðŸš€

## Installation

```sh
npm install excel-builder-vanilla
```

The project offers 3 different bundle types, choose the best for your use case
1. ESM: to `import from` (preferred)
2. CJS: CommonJS to support old NodeJS `require()` - will probably be removed in the future
3. IIFE: standalone script with `ExcelBuilder` available on the `window` object

```ts
// ESM (preferred) - npm install
import { createWorksheet } from 'excel-builder-vanilla';

// CJS - npm install
const { createWorksheet } = require('excel-builder-vanilla');

// IIFE - CDN
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/excel-builder-vanilla@3.0.0/dist/excel-builder.iife.js"></script>
<script>
  const worksheet = ExcelBuilder.createWorksheet(); // or window.ExcelBuilder.createWorksheet();
</script>
```

### CSP (Content Security Policy)
Please note that since we use `fflate` (which creates and compresses the Excel file before sending it to the browser), you might get some CSP errors because of its use of Web Workers. For that reason, you might need to adjust your CSP rules to include the following CSP rule `worker-src 'self' blob:;`

```html
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
  content="default-src 'self';
  // ...other rules
  worker-src 'self' blob:;" />
```

### Used by

This fork was created mostly to support Tree Shaking (ESM), provide TS Types and update all its dependencies. It is used by a few other Open Source libraries that I also maintain and requires Excel export:

- [Angular-Slickgrid](https://github.com/ghiscoding/Angular-Slickgrid)
- [Aurelia-Slickgrid](https://github.com/ghiscoding/aurelia-slickgrid)
- [Slickgrid-React](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-react)
- [Slickgrid-Universal](https://github.com/ghiscoding/slickgrid-universal)

1. clone the lib:
   - `git clone https://github.com/ghiscoding/excel-builder-vanilla`
2. install it with **pnpm** from the project root:
   - `pnpm install` OR `npx pnpm install`
3. run a full TypeScript build
   - `pnpm run build` OR `npx pnpm run build`
4. run in development mode (lib & demo)
   - `pnpm run dev` OR `npx pnpm run dev`

#### Pull Request Contribution

Before submitting a PR (pull request), please make sure that you followed these steps for a better chance of a successfull PR:

1. make sure that you have already executed `pnpm install`
2. run the Biome lint npm script (or use step 4)
   - `pnpm run biome:lint:write`
3. run the Biome code formatting npm script (or use step 4)
   - `pnpm run biome:format:write`
4. run a full Build (this will also run Biome lint/format, so you could skip step 2)
   - `pnpm run build`
