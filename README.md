## Description

Excel-Builder-Vanilla is a fork of the popular [excel-builder.js](https://github.com/stephenliberty/excel-builder.js) library (thanks to @stephenliberty for this great lib). This fork was based on its latest known version. The main difference from the original lib is that we migrated the project to TypeScript and dropped the `Q` and `Lodash` dependencies and we now use native code and this mean there is only 1 external dependency left which is JSZip.

This lib allows you to build an Excel file dynamically.

To get started take a look at the [Live demo](https://ghiscoding.github.io/excel-builder-vanilla/) for all available options and methods that the library offers.
